# Ensemble-Modeling-2-on-Universal-Bank-Dataset

A Ensemble Model predictive analysis of customers accepting a personal loan (Heterogenous Ensemble Models).

This was a SAS Enterprise Miner-based project using 16 models to predict whether customers would accept a personal loan from their bank. There were 4 weaker models (Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, Neural Network, and Logistic Regression), and 3 iterations of the 4 Ensemble node methods: Average, Maximum, Voting Average, and Voting Proportion. The best model (Maximum) generated a 100% sensitivity and 89% accuracy, improving accuracy of true positives from the baseline by 9%.
